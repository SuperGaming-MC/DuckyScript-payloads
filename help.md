If you are struggling to navigate this repository, here is a step-by-step guide to getting started!

1. First, read the license and the README to know a bit about this project
2. Then navigate into the Code/payloads/Library folder
3. Then you will see a couple of categories like Shamless plug and Prank/Rickroll navigate into one
4. Then you will see folders relating to those topics; navigate into one
5. Then you will see folders saying Mac OS and Windows; navigate into one of the folders that match the operating system you want to run the bad USB on
6. There will be a .txt file; navigate into it and click download
